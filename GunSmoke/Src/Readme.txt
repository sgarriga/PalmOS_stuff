About
=====

Gun Smoke is a utility for target pistol shooters. It analyses shot 
groupings and provides a brief suggestion as to cause, and maybe even 
suggests something to help. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO REPLACE FIREARMS 
TRAINING WITH A COMPETENT INSTRUCTOR.

Gun Smoke uses Mathlib. MathLib is a free shared library that can be
used by any OS 2.0+ Pilot program that needs IEEE 754 double precision
math functions. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU Library 
General Public License, and is freely available with full source code 
and documentation at the MathLib Information web page. It's not a part
of the Gun Smoke program, and you're not paying anything for its use; 
a copy is simply included in this archive for your convenience.
