This is a stationery project for a C++ application that runs on
a Palm OS device.  This is not a very complicated example, but 
Metrowerks C++ support for Palm OS covers all C++ language
features.  You can use zero-overhead exceptions, templates,
RTII, etc., but there is no standard library support for C++
on Palm OS devices at this time.
